NAME

HTML::PageIndex - Class to create HTML page index objects.

SYNOPSIS

 use HTML::PageIndex;

 $foo = new HTML::PageIndex;

 $zog = $foo->makeindex([total pages],[current page],[base url],[url arguement],[show prev/next]);

 print $zog;

DESCRIPTION

Will return an object which will display a dynamic index of html pages. It would look like:

	[Prev] 1 2 3 4 5 6 [Next]

makeindex([total pages],[current page],[base url],[url arguement],[show prev/next]);

This is currently the only public method. The args are as follows:

	[total pages] - How many total pages are there. 

	[current page] - What the current page is. It is expected that the using script
			 would generate this.

	[base url] - The base url to link to.

	[url arguement] - May be "", but if it isn't it will build a 
			  URL with ?[URL arguement]=[page number]

	[show prev/next] - Default is 0. If 0 it will not show [Prev] if you are on the
			first page, or [Next] if you are on the last page. If 1, it will 
			show [Prev] and [Next] as text.
